# Create your own ChatGPT

- ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an AI-powered chatbot created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) that enables users to have highly sophisticated, human-like conversations. The language model is capable of answering questions and assist in various tasks, including writing emails, essays, and code. Due to its dialogue design, ChatGPT is capable of answering follow-up questions, acknowledging errors, questioning incorrect assumptions, and declining inappropriate requests.

- The ChatGPT model was fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which completed its training in early 2022. The ChatGPT as well as the related GPT-3.5 models were trained on a high-performance Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.

- While ChatGPT possesses many strengths, being a generalized model, it may not always be the most effective solution for narrower, more specialized topics with limited training data available. Moreover, the dialog interface has not yet been made available by OpenAI for businesses to integrate.

# GPT-3
- In 2020, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) was introduced as an autoregressive language model capable to generate high-quality text that resembles human writing. The GPT-3 is the third generation of the GPT language models made available by OpenAI.

- By providing an initial prompt as input, GPT-3 has the ability to produce a continuation of the text that follows the style and structure of the input prompt. The model is capable of performing a range of tasks, including but not limited to, text classification, question answering, text generation, text summarization, named-entity recognition, and language translation.
