        "# Introduction\n",
        "- ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an AI-powered chatbot created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) that enables users to have highly sophisticated, human-like conversations. The language model is capable of answering questions and assist in various tasks, including writing emails, essays, and code. Due to its dialogue design, ChatGPT is capable of answering follow-up questions, acknowledging errors, questioning incorrect assumptions, and declining inappropriate requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The ChatGPT model was fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which completed its training in early 2022. The ChatGPT as well as the related GPT-3.5 models were trained on a high-performance Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "- While ChatGPT possesses many strengths, being a generalized model, it may not always be the most effective solution for narrower, more specialized topics with limited training data available. Moreover, the dialog interface has not yet been made available by OpenAI for businesses to integrate.\n",

        "\n",
        "- By providing an initial prompt as input, GPT-3 has the ability to produce a continuation of the text that follows the style and structure of the input prompt. The model is capable of performing a range of tasks, including but not limited to, text classification, question answering, text generation, text summarization, named-entity recognition, and language translation."

        "# ChatGPT Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "- We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as [InstructGPT](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/), but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reinforcement learning from human feedback enhances the RL agent's training by including humans in the training process. This helps account for the elements that can't be measured in the reward system.\n",
        "\n",
        "- To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune the model using [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo/). We performed several iterations of this process.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022. You can learn more about the 3.5 series [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers). ChatGPT and GPT 3.5 were trained on an Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure."

        "# ChatGPT Limitations\n",
        "- ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: during RL training, there’s currently no source of truth; training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer [depends on what the model knows](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/BgoKdAzogxmgkuuAt/behavior-cloning-is-miscalibrated), rather than what the human demonstrator knows.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ChatGPT is sensitive to tweaks to the input phrasing or attempting the same prompt multiple times. For example, given one phrasing of a question, the model can claim to not know the answer, but given a slight rephrase, can answer correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The model is often excessively verbose and overuses certain phrases, such as restating that it’s a language model trained by OpenAI. These issues arise from biases in the training data (trainers prefer longer answers that look more comprehensive) and well-known over-optimization issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ideally, the model would ask clarifying questions when the user provided an ambiguous query. Instead, our current models usually guess what the user intended.\n",
        "\n",
        "- While we’ve made efforts to make the model refuse inappropriate requests, it will sometimes respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior. We’re using the [Moderation API](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-content-moderation-tooling/) to warn or block certain types of unsafe content, but we expect it to have some false negatives and positives for now. We’re eager to collect user feedback to aid our ongoing work to improve this system."
